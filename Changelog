2.2.1 - Dec 05 2018

* Fix off-by-one error in listContains which would cause issues when 3 arguments are provided (argv[0] needle haystack1)

* Add missing copyright notice to a bunch of files

2.2.0 - Jul 14 2018

* Add "--sau-help" and "--sau-version" to "notin", "isin", and "strerror" programs.
  We use the --sau- prefix so that we continue to support the pattern of arg checking
   with the common values --help or --version.
   e.x.
    for arg in "$@";
    do
        if ( echo "${arg}" | isin "--help" "-h" "-?" );
        then
            echo "Usage: program [args]"
            exit 0
        fi
    done

* Make a few more things static in the .c files

* Add a version and copyright info as volatile strings in the compiled programs

* Add "common.h" as a dependency to the Makefile for the compiled programs, so that changes will force a recompile

* prefixitems - Clean up the help menu a bunch

* cout - Apparently "#!/usr/bin/env python3 -u" no longer works (update to the env program?) and we require unbuffered mode for that to function. So it is now hard coded to "#!/usr/bin/python3 -u" now. If your path is different you will have to change this. I see no other way to get around this other than to rewrite cout from scratch (and maybe get success?)
